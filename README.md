# M5Unit - Step16

## Overview

### SKU:U198

**Unit Step16** is a 16-position rotary encoder control unit based on the STM32G031G8U6 microcontroller. Its core function is to collect the rotary encoder’s BCD code value in real time and visualize the 0–F hexadecimal value through the integrated segment display. The device uses an I2C communication interface and supports configuring the encoder’s rotation increment direction, segment display operating modes, RGB LED color, and I2C address, making it convenient to mount multiple encoder units on the same bus simultaneously.  
With its concise and efficient design, this unit provides effective physical interaction control and real-time visual feedback. It is suitable for smart interactive devices (such as smart home control panels), equipment control interfaces (such as volume adjustment, RGB lighting control, motor speed regulation), and hardware prototyping and teaching in STEAM education scenarios.
